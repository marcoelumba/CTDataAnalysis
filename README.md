This is an on-going project...

Use Case of identifying the top backpacking places or accommodation based on prices, reviews, amenities offered and social media posts. 

Questions that I am trying to answer in this use case:
Identify the top backpacking places base on social media post
From the gathered top list identify and analyse accommodation by answering the following:
What is special about them?
Why does traveller book them instead of the other places?
Is there a deciding factor that travellers book a place among backpackers? Is it price, reviews, amenities, location (city central)....?

Functions, ideas and other codes are taken from other sources - to name a few:
